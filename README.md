* THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
* WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

- When the server is started, the Mongoose models are synched to the MongoDB database.
- Open MongoDB and connect to the MongoDB URI `mongodb://localhost:27017`. On the list of databases, click on `socialDB` to see `thoughts` and `users` data.

## Tests

Insomnia is used to test REST API calls. Please see the walk-through demonstration videos:  as well as the sections on Description and Usage to see how data is added and tested using Insomnia.

On Insomnia, the following API routes have been created and used to add, update, or remove users, friends, thoughts, and reactions in the user's database.

**USER**

- Create a new user: `POST /api/users`
- Get all users: `GET /api/users`
- Get a single user by its `id`: `GET /api/users/:userId`

- Update a user by its `id`: `PUT /api/users/:userId`

- Delete a user by its `id`: `DELETE /api/user/:userId`

**FRIEND**

- Add a new friend to a user's friend list: `POST /api/users/:userid/friends/:friendId`
- Delete a friend from a user's friend list: `DELETE /api/users/:userid/friends/:friendId`

**THOUGHT**

- Create a new thought: `POST /api/thoughts/`
- Get all thoughts: `GET /api/thoughts/`
- Get a single thought by its `id`: `GET /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
- Update a thought by its `id`: `PUT /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
- Delete a thought by its `id`: `DELETE /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
